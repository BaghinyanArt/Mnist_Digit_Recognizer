# Mnist Digit Recognizer

A simple digit recognition application built with Python, Tkinter, and PyTorch. The app allows users to draw digits and predict them using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Draw Digits**: Users can draw digits on a canvas.
- **Predict Digits**: The drawn digit is processed and predicted by a pre-trained CNN model.
- **Easy-to-use GUI**: Built using Tkinter for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **PyTorch**: For the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **NumPy**: For array operations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing (e.g., resizing, inversion).

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaghinyanArt/Mnist_Digit_Recognizer.git
```
### Navigate into the project directory

After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Mnist_Digit_Recognizer
```
### Install Dependencies
This project requires Python dependencies to run. You can install them by using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch numpy pillow
```
### Download the Model File
You need the pre-trained model file mnist_cnn.pth. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from your Google Colab environment or any other source where you've saved it.
Hereâ€™s how you can download it from Google Colab (if you're using Colab):

```python 
from google.colab import files
files.download('mnist_cnn.pth')
```
### Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python Draw_predict_CNN.py
```
This will open a Tkinter window where you can draw digits and predict them using the model.


### How to Use
1.Draw on the Canvas: Use the mouse to draw a digit on the canvas.

2.Click "Predict": Once you finish drawing, click the "Predict" button to see the digit predicted by the model.

3.Clear: If you want to clear the canvas and draw again, click the "Clear" button.
